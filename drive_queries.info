Search for all files and folders on the current user's My Drive
Use the files.list method without any parameters to return all files and folders.

GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files

Search for specific files or folders on the current user's My Drive
To search for a specific set of files or folders, use the query string q field with the files.list method to filter the files to return 
by combining one or more search terms.

A query string contains the following three parts:

 'query_term' 'operator' 'values'

where:

query_term: the query term or field to search upon.

operator:   specifies the condition for the query term.

values:     are the specific values you want to use to filter your search results.


To view the query terms and operators that you can use filter files and folders, see "Search query terms and operators".
For example, the following query string filters the search to only return folders by setting the MIME type:
q: mimeType = 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'

For more information on MIME types, see Google Workspace and Google Drive supported MIME types.


Query string examples
=====================

The following table lists examples of some basic query strings. The actual code differs depending on the client library you use for your search.

Important: The following query terms use fields from the Drive API v3. Some resource fields changed between v2 and v3. 
For example, files.name replaces files.title. If you're using Drive API v2, adjust these queries to use the v2 fields. 
For more information, see Drive API v2 and v3 comparison reference.
You must also escape special characters in your file names to make sure the query works correctly. 
For example, if a filename contains both an apostrophe (') and a backslash ("\") character, 
use a backslash to escape them: name contains 'quinn\'s paper\\essay'.

Note: These examples use the unencoded q parameter, where name = 'hello' is encoded as name+%3d+%27hello%27. 
Client libraries handle this encoding automatically.
